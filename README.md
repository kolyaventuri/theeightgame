# The Nine Game

## What is this?
This is a recreation of "The Eight Game" from the demo of [The Stanley Parable](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable/). I highly recommend playing that game sometime, it's beautiful.

## How does it work?
You press **8**.

## Installing
Clone down the repo and install dependencies with `npm i`

## Running the app
You can run the app in development mode with `npm run dev` (it will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

Alternative you can run it in production with `npm start` after running `npm build`

## Running tests
There are no tests as this is a silly joke app. Maybe I'll write some at some point.

_Note:_ I just did this for fun. Absolutely no copyright or intellectual property infringement is intended, and if the publishers of The Stanley Parable would like this work removed, they may feel free to contact me at any time and I would be happy to comply.
